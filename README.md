## Project Objectives
Train a linear regression model to determine the price of a car based on its mileage.

## Usage
1. Run make to create a virtual environment and install dependencies.
2. Run python train.py to train the model using the data file in the data directory.
3. Run python estimate.py to make an estimation. The script will prompt you for the mileage, then provide the predicted price.
4. Run python graph.py to display a graph where each element from the data file is plotted along with the resulting linear function.
